Lately i've been obsessed with edit functions. ðŸ˜‚

As i promised in @Kylo#121339, this is a preparation for next version of my [Diff extension](https://discuss.flarum.org/d/22779-diff-for-flarum). I'm not sure if i picked the right title for this extension ðŸ¤”. Anyways, edits made within the grace period immediately after posting will not be considered as formal edits. You can also ignore whitespace and case differences independently from the grace period.

- Then again, it's based on @jfcherng's [diff](https://github.com/jfcherng/php-diff) repository.
- Extension's icon made by [Freepik](https://www.flaticon.com/authors/freepik).

It raises new events for developers, called `PostWasRevisedQuietly` & `PostWasRevisedLoudly`

**! Attention: Diff for Flarum & Edit Notifications extensions are incompatible with this right now and they're planned to be compatible on their next releases.**

## Requirements

![php](https://img.shields.io/badge/php-%5E7.1.3-blue?style=flat-square) ![ext-iconv](https://img.shields.io/badge/ext-iconv-brightgreen?style=flat-square)

You can check your php version by running `php -v` and check if `iconv` is installed by running `php --ri iconv` (which should display `iconv support => enabled`).

```

## Updating

```

## Usage

Enable the extension. The grace period is 120 seconds, whitespace and case differences will be ignored by default.
